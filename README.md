#React - Search Filter.

1- this project focuses on React JS funcationality, in this project you can find a Card by typing the name of the card 

2- I've used Material UI for the designing part , the design is simple, my main point is to practice React JS

Searching Filter is one of the most important thing in web development,
every website in the world needs a search bar to quickly find something.

--- It was an amazing pracitce for me , hope "YOU" who sees this project have learned what I learned


My final word .......
** " never Stop Learning , IF you stop , you LOSE. " **
